Lesson 1:
install an atlas plugin then in project settings turn it on
import the atlas for the sprites
(alternatively for download size purposes, I picked out the exact files that were needed since that is actually more than needed for this project)
create the nodes for Area2D player and its children (Player, Sprite, CollisionShape2D)
create folder for scenes and scripts
in project settings/input map, update the input map
"player_left" - a or left
"player_right" - d or right
"player_thrust" - w or up
"player_shoot" - spacebar
create a script and play

Lesson 2:
create a new scene for bullet
create Area2d node for for the bullet and its children classes (sprite, collisionshape2d)
add sprite image and set the capsule shape for the collision, adjust as needed
add plain node as a bullet_container and load PackedScene for the bullet in player
create a timer lifetime in bullet scene, set it autostart and give it some desired time
create a position2d muzzle in player scene
create a time gun_timer in player scene, set it to one shot and give it some desired time

Lesson 3:
create KinematicBody2D for the meteors and two children
add image and set circle shape for the collision and adjust as needed
make the children unselectable for the meteor and move it to the middle
create a new scene for main and create a plain node
in Project Settings/Application/Run change the main scene to the new main (it was likely player until now)

Lesson 4:
