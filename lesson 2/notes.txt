install an atlas plugin then in project settings turn it on
import the atlas for the sprites
(alternatively for download size purposes, I picked out the exact files that were needed since that is actually more than needed for this project)
create the nodes for player and its children
create folder for scenes and scripts
in project settings/input map, update the input map
"player_left" - a or left
"player_right" - d or right
"player_thrust" - w or up
"player_shoot" - spacebar
create a script and play
